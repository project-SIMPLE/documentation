> Design virtual reality universes to give every child the opportunity to learn about environmental issues in the classroom

## Goals

The general objective of SIMPLE is to develop a coherent, persistent, multilingual set of 3D virtual universes (VUs) to raise the awareness of young audiences on environmental issues and bridge the gap between scientists, education experts, young citizens, CSOs and local authorities of the Lower Mekong countries. These VUs will share the same technological underpinnings and pedagogical methods, but will be dedicated, in each country of implementation, to a specific case study. 

## Sponsor

Co-funded by the European Union, SIMPLE is implemented by IRD and its academic partners in the lower-Mekong region, CTU and NSTDA, under the EU-ASEAN Green Partnership Call.

This website was created and maintained with the financial support of the European Union. Its contents are the sole responsibility of SIMPLE and do not necessarily reflect the views of the European Union.
